                    My favorite city is in the great state of New York. Can you guess what it is? It's a city that never
                    sleeps, it's "the big apple", it's New York City or NYC! I love everything about NYC, the people,
                    the little shops, Central park, and most of all the hustle and bustle of the city. I come from a
                    very big city in Colombia called Bogota and it shares many similarities that makes NYC feel like
                    home. With how small of an area New York City is can you believe they fit in almost 8.5 million
                    people? Below I'll share a few of my favorite places to visit when I visit.

                <p>
                    Even in a city packed with skyscrapers, New York has amazing green spaces. Central Park is the
                    obvious favorite — it’s 843 acres of pure calm in the middle of a bustling city. Now what's there to
                    do, you ask? You can row a boat on the lake, listen to various street musicians, or just lay on the
                    grass under the skyline — it’s a perfect escape. Want something a little more exciting? Head down to
                    the Central Park Zoo and see the various animal exhibits they have scattered around the zoo.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now, when should you go? Everyone has their own preferences, but my favorite times are when there
                    are seasonal changes — from the beautiful fall foliage to when life is brought back to the park
                    during the spring. Either way, a stop by Central Park will always be worth your time. Plan your
                    visit by checking out
                    <a href="https://www.centralparknyc.org" target="_blank">the Central Park webpage</a>.

                <p>
                    Let's pick back up in Central Park but this time focus on the Zoo. Located inside Central Park, the
                    Central Park Zoo offers a small but delightful experience for visitors of all ages. You may remember
                    this zoo from the Madagascar movie and might be disappointed to find out they don't have lions
                    there. Instead, they have something that I think is even more majestic which is a snow leopard!
                    Other animals include penguins, sea lions, a red panda and more! The zoo exhibits are thoughtfully
                    arranged to make exploration fun and educational. Do you have kids? Don’t miss the interactive
                    Children's Zoo, where kids are able to feed and interact with farm animals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now you're probably wondering when you should visit the zoo right? To me it seemed like the best
                    times to go are in the morning, when the animals are most active and crowds are smaller. Seasonal
                    events and animal feedings make each trip unique. Again, just like Central Park I feel like there's
                    really no wrong time of the year to go though I wouldn't want to walk around too much in the middle
                    of summer but that's just me. Make sure you plan ahead by visiting
                    <a href="https://centralparkzoo.com" target="_blank">the Central Park Zoo website</a> for tickets
                    and schedules.

                <p>
                    After walking through Central Park, the American Museum of Natural History is just a short walk
                    away. It feels like leaving the calm of the park and stepping into a world of giant dinosaurs and
                    exciting space exhibits. You can see tall skeletons, sparkling gems, and galleries that show the
                    story of people and the Earth. If you want one place that gives you a sense of wonder without
                    walking too far, this is it. (<a href="https://www.amnh.org/" target="_blank">amnh.org</a>)
                </p>

                <p>
                    A little further east is the Metropolitan Museum of Art, or the Met, one of the most famous art
                    museums in the world. From Egyptian treasures to modern paintings, there is something new to see
                    around every corner. You can stop in front of a Renaissance painting or explore an Asian art
                    gallery. Take your time, pick an area you like, and wander without a plan. You’ll probably find
                    your favorite part on your own. (<a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/" target="_blank"

                    No visit to New York City is complete without seeing the Empire State Building and the Statue of
                    Liberty. The Empire State Building rises high above the streets and offers incredible views of the
                    NYC skyline. Walking through its lobby feels like stepping back into classic New York. A trip to the
                    observation deck gives a perspective of the city that is unforgettable. Don't forget to take a
                    picture of yourself being grabbed by King Kong!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now onto the Statue of Liberty. Do I even have to introduce her? The Statue of Liberty can be found
                    across the harbor. On the small island the statue stands as a symbol of freedom and opportunity.
                    Taking a ferry ride to Liberty Island is both scenic and inspiring. You can walk around the base of
                    the statue, explore the museum, and take in breathtaking views of Lower Manhattan. Both landmarks
                    are iconic and visiting them helps you truly appreciate the heart and soul of New York City. (<a
